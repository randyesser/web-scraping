# web-scraping
TCC data analysis bootcamp web scraping challenge

The challenge requires the use of two Jupyter notebooks to leverage Python-based web-scraping libraries to access, organize, and present Mars news and weather data from a static EdX provided webpage.

This repo contains my deliverables for the above challenge.

## Structure
Repo file structure is as follows:
- README.md: this file
- mars_weather.csv: sample CSV output from part 2
- part_1_mars_news.ipynb: the news scraping notebook
- part_2_mars_weather.ipynb: the weather data scraping notebook
